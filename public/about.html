<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Jessica, I am from Redwood City, CA, and I am currently learning Web Development. <br/>
  Redwood City is the next city over from the Meta headquaters and a short drive to the Apple Campus so I have been surrounded by different tech companies and have met a lot of different people in tech. 
  I have been intriqued with Web development for quite some time, learned to make my own websites in high school, but I did not fully dedicate to learning until this year.
  My goal is to end 2023 with a Web Development certificate, and to continue to learn and grow in 2024.

<p>I am excited to meet you and work with you!</p>
